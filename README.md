# pino_wgpu_shape

a primitive shape rendering library for wgpu

</div>

**pino_wgpu_shape** is a very simple wgpu shape renderering library that supports drawing basic shapes like triangle, quads, lines and more. It was written to learn a bit about wgpu.

Currently, **pino_wgpu_shape** uses [cgmath](https://github.com/rustgd/cgmath) as the underlying math library. Might also be considering to switch over to [glam](https://github.com/bitshifter/glam-rs) or provide a feature flag to support this.
