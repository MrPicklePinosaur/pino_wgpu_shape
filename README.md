# pino_wgpu_shape

a primitive shape rendering library for wgpu

</div>

**pino_wgpu_shape** is a very simple wgpu shape renderering library
that supports drawing basic shapes like triangle, quads, lines and
more. It was written to learn a bit about wgpu.

A lot of this code was inspired by the awesome crate [wgpu_glyph](https://github.com/hecrj/wgpu_glyph)
